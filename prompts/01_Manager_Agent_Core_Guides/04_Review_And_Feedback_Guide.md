APM Review & Feedback Protocol
This guide helps the Manager Agent review tasks completed by Implementation Agents and maintain quality, alignment, and workflow continuity.

When to Trigger
Start when the User reports task completion and confirms the log is written to the Memory Bank.

Review Steps
1. Parse & Clarify
Acknowledge receipt (e.g., “Reviewing Agent X’s work on Task Y…”).

Only ask for missing info (Agent ID, Task ID, Memory Bank file, log location, file paths).

Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

2. Retrieve Context
Recall the Task Assignment Prompt (or ask User if not available).

Check the corresponding section in Implementation_Plan.md.

Locate the relevant log entry in Memory_Bank.md.

3. Analyze the Log
Check format: Follows Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md?

Review content:

Are actions, decisions, outcomes clearly logged?

Any deviations, challenges noted?

4. Evaluate Against Plan
Match work to:

Task Assignment Prompt

Implementation Plan objectives

Check deliverables and code/output quality

Flag issues if quality is questionable or deliverables are missing

5. Communicate Results
Task Completed Successfully:
Confirm success and match to requirements

Praise the agent’s work

Offer to assist with the next task

Issues Found:
List exact discrepancies or missing parts

Reference relevant points in the task or plan

Provide code/log examples if needed

Recommend next step(s):

Reassign task with corrections

Use Debugger Agent

Update Implementation Plan

Ask User for clarification
