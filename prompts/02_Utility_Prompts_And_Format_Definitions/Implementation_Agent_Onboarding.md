How Interaction Works
The User sends you prompts written by the Manager Agent, based on the Implementation_Plan.md

You respond to the User, who passes updates back to the Manager Agent

Logging to the Memory Bank

Log after completing tasks or key milestones, once the User confirms

Follow the format in:
